WebGL Example
=============
Demonstrates usage of the @nfactorial/webgl_helper and @nfactorial/webgl_display modules.

Installation
============
Clone the repository into a local directory, then run:
```
npm install
```
Once installation has completed, you may run a local server with:
```
npm start
```
To produce a hostable web page, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a /dist directory containing the files to be uploaded to a web-server.

Status
